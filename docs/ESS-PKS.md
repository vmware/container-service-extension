their purchased VMware Essential PKS product so they can natively offer

## Enablement

CSE 2.5 comes with the built-in capability to leverage VMware Essential PKS. In
order to access the capability, Service Providers must purchase VMware
Essential PKS. They then get access to VMware Essential PKS K8s template for
use in CSE 2.5. Once the capability is turned on, VMware Essential PKS template
based K8s cluster deployments work similarly to all other Native templates
based K8s cluster deployments.

If you have the purchased VMware Essential PKS product, please open a
[GitHub issue](https://www.github.com/vmware/container-service-extension/issues)
to get access to its K8s template.
