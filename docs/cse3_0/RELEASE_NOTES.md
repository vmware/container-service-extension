  * Fixed bug where cluster/node creation wizard does not show shared ovdc networks
  * PKS clusters now display Kubernetes version
  * Read more about it [here](CSE_UI_PLUGIN.html)

**Notes to System Administrator**

If you are upgrading to CSE 2.6.1 from an older version of CSE, and you have
* Kubernetes 1.15, 1.16 or 1.17 based template created by CSE 2.5.x:
  * You must recreate/replace those templates with their latest version available.
* Pre-existing deployed native K8s clusters, you must run the following command:
  ```sh
  cse convert-cluster [cluster name]
  ```
  * From CSE 2.5.x - To be able to upgrade the clusters.
  * From CSE older than 2.5.0 - To preserve manageability of the clusters.

This command adds new metadata to the clusters. If the clusters were deployed
by CSE version below 2.5.0, the command will also reset the admin password of
all nodes in the clusters. If nodes in the clusters were setup with ssh keys
for root login, those key pairings will be preserved. The command will force a
reboot of the clusters, if admin password is reset.

**Enterprise PKS**

Existing Enterprise PKS clusters deployed via CSE will continue to function
when PKS is upgraded to version 1.7. The cluster network isolation will also
remain intact when NSX-T is upgraded to version 2.5.1. Please follow PKS and
NSX-T manual(s) to perform the respective upgrades.

- [Role based access control](RBAC.html) - Enabling
 this feature allows users granted with specific K8 rights only to deploy K8 clusters.

**Notes to System Administrator**

When more than one K8 provider exists in the system, system administrator is required to
perform an extra step of enabling organization vdc(s) with a desired K8 provider
(Native/Enterprise PKS).

To be specific,
- If Enterprise PKS is not in the set up, users are allowed to deploy K8 clusters in any organization vdc.
- If Enterprise PKS is present in the CSE set up, users are allowed to deploy K8 clusters only in those
organization vdc(s) enabled either for Native (or) Enterprise PKS.

Click [here](CSE_CONFIG.html#pksconfig) for more details.
