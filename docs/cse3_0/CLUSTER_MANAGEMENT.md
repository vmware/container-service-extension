# Kubernetes Cluster Management

<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

This page shows basic commands that allow tenants to create, manage,
and remove Kubernetes clusters using CSE. The primary tool for these
operations is the `vcd cse` client command.

Here is an overview of the process that a tenant administrator might
go through to install `vcd cse` and create a cluster. It includes
some internals of CSE so that you can understand what is happening
behind the covers.

CSE Kubernetes clusters can include persistent volumes mounted on NFS.
Procedures for creating and managing NFS nodes can be found at
[NFS Node Management](NFS_STATIC_PV.html).

## Useful Commands
`vcd cse ...` commands are used by tenant organization administrators and users to:
- list templates
- get CSE server status
- create, list, info, delete clusters/nodes

Here is a summary of commands available to view templates and manage clusters and nodes:

<a name="cse30_cli_changes"></a>
CSE 3.0 introduces few of the below changes in CLI
1. CLI is smart enough to display the most relevant commands and command 
options based on the API version with which the CSE server is running. 
This intelligence will only be enabled when the user logs into the environment
 using `vcd login` command. For example: `vcd cse cluster apply` is displayed 
 only if CSE server is running at api version >= 35.0. Refer [what commands are available for what CSE versions?](TROUBLESHOOTING.html#cmds-per-cse) for more details.
2. One can use CLI to deploy Tkg Clusters even without CSE server installed. 
CLI directly communicates with the Cloud Director to manage Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.
3. Node commands have been deprecated for CSE 3.0. All of the node management 
(or) resize operations can be done through `vcd cse cluster apply` command in 
CSE 3.0. Node commands continue to be operational if CSE server is running with
 vCD API version <= 34.0
4. New command has been added for NFS deletion: `vcd cse cluster delete-nfs`
5. Separate command group for Ent-PKS: `vcd cse pks â€“help`

For CSE versions < 3.0, by default, CSE Client will display the task progress until the
task finishes or fails. The `--no-wait` flag can be used to skip waiting on the
task. CSE client will still show the task information of console, and end user
can choose to monitor the task progress manually.

```sh
> vcd --no-wait cse cluster create CLUSTER_NAME --network intranet --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# displays the status and progress of the task
> vcd task wait 377e802d-f278-44e8-9282-7ab822017cbd

# lists the current running tasks in the organization
> vcd task list running
```

### CSE 3.0 `Cluster apply` command

1. `vcd cse cluster apply <create_cluster.yaml>` command - Takes a cluster specification file as an input and applies it to a cluster resource. The cluster resource will be created if it does not exist. 
    * Command usage examples:
        ```sh
        vcd cse cluster apply <resize_cluster.yaml> (applies the specification on the resource specified; the cluster resource will be created if it does not exist). 
        vcd cse cluster apply --sample --tkg (generates the sample specification file for tkg clusters).
        vcd cse cluster apply --sample --native (generates the sample specification file for native clusters).
        ```
    * Sample input specification file
        ```sh
        # Short description of various properties used in this sample cluster configuration
        # kind: The kind of the Kubernetes cluster.
        #

## Upgrading software installed on Kubernetes clusters
Kubernetes is a fast paced piece of software, which gets a new minor release
every three months and numerous patch releases (including security patches) in
between those minor releases. To keep already deployed clusters up to date, in
CSE 2.6.0 we have added support for in place software upgrade for Kubernetes
clusters. The softwares that can be upgraded to a newer version are
* Kuberenetes components e.g. kube-server, kubelet, kubedns etc.
* Weave (CNI)
* Docker engine

The upgrade matrix is built on the CSE native templates (read more about them
[here](TEMPLATE_MANAGEMENT.html)). The template
originally used to deploy a cluster determines the valid target templates for
upgrade. The supported upgrade paths can be discovered using the following command

```sh
vcd cse cluster upgrade-plan 'mycluster'
```

Let's say our cluster was deployed using template T1 which is based off
Kubernetes version `x.y.z`. Our potential target templates for upgrade will
satisfy at least one of the following criteria:
* A later revision of the template T1, which is based off Kubernetes version
  `x.y.`**`w`**, where `w` > `z`.
* A template T2 that has the same base OS, and is based off Kubernetes
  distribution `x.`**`(y+1)`**`.v`, where `v` can be anything.

If you don't see a desired target template for upgrading your cluster, please
feel free to file a GitHub [issue ](https://github.com/vmware/container-service-extension/issues).


The actual upgrade of the cluster is done via the following command.
```sh
vcd cse cluster upgrade 'mycluster'
```

The upgrade process needs little to zero downtime, if the following conditions
are met,
1. Docker is not being upgraded.
2. Weave (CNI) is not being upgraded.
3. Kubernetes version upgrade is restricted to patch version only.

If any of the conditions mentioned above is not met, the cluster will go down
for about a minute or more (depends on the actual upgrade process).

## Automation
`vcd cse` commands can be scripted to automate the creation and operation
of Kubernetes clusters and nodes.

Users can interact with CSE via the Python package (container-service-extension)
or the CSE REST API exposed via VCD.

This following Python script creates a Kubernetes cluster on vCloud Director:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pyvcloud.vcd.client import BasicLoginCredentials
from pyvcloud.vcd.client import Client
from container_service_extension.client.cluster import Cluster

client = Client('vcd.mysp.com')
client.set_credentials(BasicLoginCredentials('usr1', 'org1', '******'))

cse = Cluster(client)
result= cse.create_cluster('vdc1', 'net1', 'cluster1')
task = client.get_resource(result['task_href'])
task = client.get_task_monitor().wait_for_status(task)
print(task.get('status'))

client.logout()
```

## Example Use Case

Please note that several of the commands are version specific. Not all the 
commands are applicable to all versions of CSE. Please refer to [CLI commands per CSE version](TROUBLESHOOTING.html#cmds-per-cse)

> vcd cse cluster apply scale_up_nfs.yaml

# [CSE 3.0] Delete Nfs node in a given cluster
> vcd cse cluster delete-nfs mycluster nfsd-ghyt

# resize the cluster to have 8 worker node. If resize fails, the cluster is returned to it's original size.
# '--network' is only applicable for clusters using native (VCD) Kubernetes provider.
> vcd cse cluster resize mycluster --network mynetwork --nodes 8

# info on a given node. If the node is of type nfsd, it displays info about Exports.

# list available clusters
> vcd cse cluster list

# info on a given cluster

# retrieve cluster config
> vcd cse cluster config mycluster > ~/.kube/config

# check cluster configuration
> kubectl get nodes

# deploy a sample application
> kubectl create namespace sock-shop

> kubectl apply -n sock-shop -f "https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/complete-demo.yaml?raw=true"

# check that all pods are running and ready
> kubectl get pods --namespace sock-shop

# access the application
> IP=`vcd cse cluster list|grep '\ mycluster'|cut -f 1 -d ' '`
> open "http://${IP}:30001"

# delete cluster when no longer needed
> vcd cse cluster delete mycluster --yes
```
